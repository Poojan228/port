            <h2>Understanding OSCC</h2>
            <p>Sharing resources through hardwired connections is quickly being replaced with a delivery method that
                provides
                infrastructure, services, platforms, and applications on demand, across networks.</p>

            <h2>What is cloud Computing?</h2>
            <p>Cloud computing is the act of running workloads within clouds—which are IT environments that abstract,
                pool,
                and
                share scalable resources across a network. Neither cloud computing nor clouds are technologies unto
                themselves.
            <ul>
                <li>Cloud computing is an act—the function of running a workload in a cloud.</li>
                <li> Clouds are environments—places where applications run.</li>
                <li>Technologies are things—software and hardware used to build and use clouds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why choose the oscc?</h2>
            <h3>Because the foundation of your cloud matters</h3>
            <p>Our open hybrid cloud strategy, supported by our open source technologies brings a consistent foundation
                to
                any
                cloud deployment: public, private, hybrid, or multi. Open hybrid cloud is Red Hat's recommended strategy
                for
                architecting, developing, and operating a hybrid mix of applications, delivering a truly flexible cloud
                experience with the speed, stability, and scale required for digital business transformation.
            </p><br>
            <p>This strategy gives developers a common application environment to develop, orchestrate, and run their
                applications, while giving sysadmins and operations teams a common operating environment to manage their
                infrastructure. With this consistency across environments you can deliver automated IT infrastructure.

            <h2>Cloud management</h2>
            <p>Cloud management is how administrators control—and orchestrate—all the products and services that operate
                in
                a
                cloud: the users and access control, data, applications, and services. It's about giving admins the
                ability
                to
                access the resources they need, automate those processes that they want to, and make adjustments as
                needed,
                while also monitoring usage and cost. It's also how admins maintain flexibility and scalablity, while
                being
                able
                to adapt quickly when things change. </p>

                Cloud mangement tools help admins oversee all types of cloud (public cloud, private cloud, hybrid and
                multicloud) and cloud activities, from resource deployment and use tracking to data integration,
                Kubernetes,
                and
                disaster recovery. They provide administrative control over the infrastructure, platforms, applications,
                cloud
                provider and cloud service provider resources, and data that—together—create a cloud.</p>

            <h2>What is a managed service provider (MSP)?</h2>
            <p>The third party that delivers services is called a managed services provider. A managed IT services
                provider
                is
                most often an IT services provider that manages and assumes responsibility for providing a defined set
                of
                services to its clients either proactively or as the MSP (not the client) determines that services are
                needed.
            </p><br>
            <p>The managed service provider is responsible for the functionality of the service or equipment, managed
                under
                a
                Service Level Agreement (SLA). The customer receiving the service often pays a monthly subscription fee.
            </p><br>
            <p>Organizations outsource the responsibility for maintaining, and anticipating the need for, a range of
                processes
                and functions in order to improve operations, cut expenses, and realize other benefits.

            <h2>What are the benefits of using managed services?</h2>
            <p>Managed services are beneficial for both large organizations and small businesses; new companies and
                established
                ones. Some of the benefits of using managed services include:
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <br>
                <b> Filling the skills gap.</b> Managed services can be good for teams that don’t have the time, skills,
                or
                experience internally to manage certain business functions on their own, or they choose to focus their
                efforts on
                something else. Relying on an expert to provide a service allows your teams to focus on innovation
                without
                getting
                bogged down in routine tasks.
                <br><br>

                <b>Cost savings.</b> Many managed services are tied to variable cloud expenses. These services can save
                you
                money on staff and training. Other managed services are tied to a fixed monthly charge. Using a managed
                service
                instead of building the capability in-house can be cheaper and the costs can be more predictable, which
                is
                helpful for budgeting.
                <br><br>

                <b> Reliability.</b> You can worry less about outages because the managed service provider is
                responsible
                for keeping the service available at all times. The service and support are provided under a service
                level
                agreement
                (SLA) so it is clear what to expect and when to expect it. An in-house team is often juggling multiple
                responsibilities but an MSP can focus on perfecting delivery of their specific service. This means
                focusing
                on the health and security of the service, applying patches and upgrades as needed.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="seven">
            <h2>What kinds of managed services are available?</h2>
            <p>Managed IT services can range from quite general to very specific, depending on your needs. Common
                services
                can
                include the monitoring and maintenance of equipment, systems management, remote monitoring and
                management of
                servers, network monitoring, and other services.</p><br>
            <p>The traditional approach to managed services is a break/fix model which monitors systems until there is a
                problem
                to remediate. Many modern managed services providers take a more proactive approach to maintenance and
                management which can include patch management and predictive maintenance.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/pngegg.png" alt="" class="mid-2">
            <p>Cloud-based managed services can range from specific applications delivered "as a service" (Software as a
                Service, or SaaS) to platforms and infrastructure as a service (IaaS and PaaS). These services can help
                businesses scale rapidly to meet increasing demand without the associated datacenter costs. Cloud-based
                services
                can also provide greater access to data, analytics, and storage.
            </p><br>
            <p>Other companies provide managed security services for both traditional bare metal infrastructure and
                cloud
                services. Having reliable and trusted security experts is especially important to companies with hybrid
                cloud
                infrastructure.

            <h2>Cloud services</h2>
            <p>Cloud Services include hosted and managed platform, application, and data services that accelerate time
                to
                value
                and reduce the operational cost and complexity of delivering cloud-native applications. Organizations
                can
                confidently build and scale applications with a streamlined experience across services and across clouds
                while
                Red Hat manages the rest.

            <p>OSCC’s cloud services comprise a platform for developing, deploying, and scaling cloud-native
                applications in
                open hybrid-cloud environments. The combination of enterprise-grade Kubernetes, cloud-native approach to
                application delivery, and managed operations allows enterprise development teams to increase application
                velocity and focus on core competencies.
            </p><br>
            <p>Platform services are hosted application platforms.
            </p><br>
            <p>Application services are on-demand services that can be used to build and connect applications.
            </p><br>
            <p>Data services provide on-demand data access, storage, prep, and/or analysis.
